# Warning

This mod (or script) might conflict with other mods, such as: (idk)

I only make this to let computer do the tedious and repetitive task accurately.

# Usage

The mod adds a button in editor pause menu (bottom-left) and ask you to select FNF chart file. Then it will automatically creates bunch of triggers at your selected object, if multiple selected it will pick the highest X and Y pos, if none it will be at Y 5025. That's it.

It's better to test it in empty level.

only old PsychEngine chart (pre v1.0 and older) is supported rn. might update soon or nevr
