# Warning

This mod (or script) might conflict with other mods (it shouldn't and i hope it wont).

I only make this to let computer do the tedious and repetitive task accurately.

# Usage

The mod adds a button in editor pause menu (bottom-left) and ask you to select chart file. Then it will automatically creates bunch of triggers at your selected object, if multiple selected it will pick the highest X and Y pos, if none it will be at Y 5025. That's it.

It's better to test it in empty level.

support muse dash DEserialized chart for now (this usually required 2 apps to be used, will upload a muse dash asset extractor soon or later so it can work with this, separated .exe). might update soon or nevr.
if you want to use this for fnf chart, use older version on github.
