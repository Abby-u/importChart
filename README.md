# Warning

This mod (or script) might conflict with other mods (it shouldn't and i hope it wont).

I only make this to let computer do the tedious and repetitive task accurately.

# Usage

The mod adds a button in editor pause menu (bottom-left) and ask you to select chart file. Then it will automatically creates bunch of triggers at your selected object, if multiple selected it will pick the highest X and Y pos, if none it will be at Y 5025. That's it.

It's better to test it in empty level.

support muse dash .bundle chart(requires [mdextract](https://github.com/Abby-u/mdextract)), fnf old PsychEngine (pre v1.0 and older) and v-slice chart. might update soon or nevr.
if you want to use this for fnf chart, use older version on github.

im planning to make trigger outputs to be customizable based on user needs but idk how to implement that yet (prolly tedius and confusing)
